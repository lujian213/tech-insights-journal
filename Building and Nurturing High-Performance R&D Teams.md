# Building and Nurturing High-Performance R&D Teams
As a senior technical manager with many years of experience in software development, I have created and managed more than 
a dozen R&D teams. Some were built from scratch, while others I took over midway. These teams ranged from small groups of 
a dozen people to large, cross-regional departments with hundreds of members. Most recently, starting in mid-2019, I built 
a team from zero, which grew into an R&D department of over 700 people in three and a half years. Through these experiences, 
I have accumulated many lessons and insights on team creation and management. Here are some of my thoughts and summaries 
on team formation.

## Talent Needs

Precisely identify the talent needs within the team. Consider what types of people are currently needed, what is lacking, 
and what will be needed in the future. Avoid homogeneity, such as only seeking technical skills or English proficiency. 
Define talent requirements from the perspective of the entire team and overall project delivery.

- For example, someone with strong technical skills may not be good at communication, which could become a bottleneck for 
team development.
- Some people may have average technical skills but possess deep business understanding and sharp product insight, making 
them highly valuable to the team.
- A reasonable combination and mix of talents is key. A diverse team composition enhances competitiveness.

A healthy team needs a gradient. While ensuring high-quality delivery, consider the development space for team members. 
Without enough gradient, a new team may face instability and high turnover after one or two years, and new hires will 
struggle to adapt quickly, increasing project delivery risks.

- There should be an appropriate ratio of junior, mid-level, and senior members. This is not only a cost consideration 
but also lays the foundation for talent development. Having only the most expensive and best people is not optimal, as 
senior talent may soon face a lack of growth opportunities if the team is not expanding.
- Teams inevitably change, so always have a plan B. The best plan B is always internal promotion, and only look outside 
if there is no suitable internal candidate. Talent development takes time, so a sufficient gradient ensures members have 
time and patience to grow within the organization.
- Fresh blood, especially young people, brings vitality to the team. This is crucial for maintaining organizational energy 
and creativity.

Work assignments should match talent requirements. In other words, the work must be challenging and offer growth 
opportunities to attract talent. Outstanding people will not waste time in roles without challenge or growth.

## Recruitment

Rapid team building often faces tremendous recruitment pressure. Despite significant investment from both recruitment and 
business teams, the results are often unsatisfactory, with much wasted time and effort. The root cause is poor collaboration 
and lack of mutual understanding between the two teams, leading to blame-shifting and reluctance to take responsibility. 
In my experience, if business and recruitment teams work closely together, maintain timely and effective communication, 
and quickly resolve issues, recruitment effectiveness can improve by more than 50%.

- The recruitment team must fully understand the business team’s needs. The business team can provide training to help 
recruiters better understand requirements and screen candidates more effectively. Being able to answer candidates’ questions 
professionally enhances the company’s image and attractiveness.
- Fully leverage the enthusiasm of internal staff for referrals to improve recruitment efficiency and quality. Internal 
referrals are often the main source of high-quality candidates. Keep referral channels transparent and feedback timely to 
maintain employee engagement.
- During recruitment, the business team should promptly provide feedback on resumes and candidate fit, helping recruiters 
adjust direction and improve screening efficiency and accuracy.
- When screening resumes, recruiters should consider interviewers’ feedback and, from a professional and holistic perspective, 
identify candidates’ strengths and potential, seeking broader matches. Use resume resources efficiently and fairly, avoiding 
waste due to one-sided evaluations.
- Recruiters should also collect feedback from candidates and relay it to the business team, enabling targeted interviewer 
training to improve skills and correct unprofessional behavior or biases.
- Business and recruitment leaders should communicate regularly (e.g., daily stand-ups) to resolve collaboration issues 
and efficiency bottlenecks (such as delayed feedback) in a timely manner, aiming to solve problems the same day.
- Trust each other and respect each other’s expertise. When problems arise, focus on “how can I help the other party better” 
rather than “you are not good enough, let me do it.”
- Make full use of statistics to analyze and optimize each recruitment stage, such as resume screening efficiency, interviewer 
pass rates, average feedback time, offer drop rates, and candidate feedback. Use data analysis to identify problems and 
bottlenecks and adjust strategies accordingly.

Only by truly treating each other as team members, sharing the same goals, and understanding that “helping others is helping 
yourself,” can recruitment work achieve twice the result with half the effort.

## Interview

The interview is a two-way selection process. Interviewers need to understand the candidate’s abilities and potential, 
while candidates are also evaluating whether the company and team are suitable for them.

- Fully respect candidates and select interviewers whose level and experience match the position, avoiding mismatches. 
If junior staff assist in certain areas, senior staff should lead the interview, with juniors as support. Whether online 
or offline, maintain interview etiquette, use encouragement and guidance, and avoid unprofessional behavior or remarks. 
This helps candidates perform at their best in a relaxed environment.
- Interviewers must have professional skills and knowledge to accurately assess candidates’ abilities and potential. Exclude 
irrelevant factors such as gender, age, or region. Use open-ended questions to objectively and comprehensively evaluate 
candidates. Provide ongoing training for interviewers, especially new ones, and promptly correct any unprofessional behavior.
- Respect candidates’ time, keep the process transparent, and provide timely feedback to avoid long waits. Prompt feedback 
demonstrates professionalism and respect, and also improves recruitment efficiency.
- The interview is an opportunity for both sides to understand each other’s expectations and needs, avoiding misunderstandings 
about job content or working style. Prevent situations where candidates find a large gap between expectations and reality 
after joining, which wastes recruitment resources.
- Reasonable evaluation criteria, including technical ability, communication skills, and teamwork, help interviewers assess 
candidates more effectively. There is no absolute “qualified” or “unqualified” candidate, only suitable or not.
- Focus on different aspects for different roles and levels. For junior positions, emphasize educational background and 
basic knowledge; for mid-level, focus on work experience, project background, and technical skills; for senior roles, 
emphasize leadership, influence, and strategic thinking.

A successful interview process improves recruitment efficiency and quality while reducing costs. Small details in the 
interview process can have unexpected positive effects, such as enhancing the company’s reputation and reducing offer drop 
rates.

## New Employee Training

Hiring is only the first step in team building. Helping new employees quickly integrate into the team and understand its 
working style and values is key to success. New employee training is a crucial part of this process. Making good use of 
onboarding opportunities deepens new hires’ understanding of organizational culture and team atmosphere, laying a solid 
foundation for future work and collaboration.

- Set clear and reasonable expectations for newcomers. Reduce anxiety about the unfamiliar environment and encourage them 
to ask questions and express their ideas.
- Encourage new employees to learn about the company’s structure, business, and products, and understand the importance 
of both technology and business, as well as communication in daily work.
- Clarify our ways of working, emphasizing the importance and necessity of teamwork, and balancing results with process.
- Clarify our values. Encourage curiosity, willingness to try, courage to challenge, enthusiasm for sharing, and continuous 
learning and growth.
- Arrange cross-level newcomer forums to address new employees’ questions and concerns directly, providing feedback and 
suggestions.
- Assign a buddy to help new employees solve common problems in daily work. Prepare an electronic FAQ to help them get 
started quickly.
- Provide targeted training covering technology, environment, business, and management.

Effective onboarding shortens the adaptation period, reduces confusion and anxiety, and helps new employees quickly adapt 
to the work pace and team atmosphere, improving efficiency.

## Building Team Atmosphere

A positive team atmosphere stimulates enthusiasm and creativity, enhancing cohesion and centripetal force. Building team 
atmosphere is a long-term process that requires continuous investment and attention. Management should creatively organize 
activities to strengthen team bonds.

- Organize group activities to enhance cohesion and collective honor, build trust and friendship, and promote communication 
and collaboration.
- Hold innovation competitions to foster awareness and ability, encouraging members to try new technologies and methods 
beyond daily project work, creating more opportunities for technical improvement.
- Use internal projects to strengthen engineering culture. Encourage contributors to identify and solve pain points, and 
encourage recipients to provide feedback and support, forming a positive feedback loop. Promote internal open-source projects 
and cross-team collaboration and sharing.
- Organize activities that encourage curiosity, asking “why,” and expressing ideas. Only by developing the habit of 
questioning can team members better identify problems and suggest improvements.
- Form cross-team working groups to coordinate capabilities such as innovation, engineering excellence, talent development, 
diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement. Achieve team atmosphere goals through self-organized activities.

A positive team atmosphere improves stability and reduces turnover, while helping members find motivation and direction 
for self-improvement and continuous growth.

## Frontline Manager Training

All upper-level ideas and strategies are ultimately implemented by frontline managers, who interact most frequently with 
employees. Their management skills directly affect team atmosphere and efficiency, making their training and development 
crucial.

- Frontline managers must clearly understand company strategy and goals, knowing what to do and why, to translate them 
into actionable plans.
- Avoid the numbers trap. All actions must align with strategic intent, not just meet numerical targets. This is the most 
direct way to test if measures are correct.
- Correct results come from correct processes and behaviors, not just focusing on results. Blindly pursuing results while 
ignoring process often backfires.
- Frontline managers must lead by example. Their words and actions directly or indirectly influence employees, so they 
must set a good example. The worst is saying one thing and doing another.
- During strategy implementation, employees will encounter various problems and difficulties. Frontline managers must 
provide timely support and help solve practical issues. Otherwise, employees will see strategy as empty talk, leading to 
falsification or window dressing.
- During project development, there will inevitably be interference and conflicts from stakeholders, upstream and downstream, 
or clients. Frontline managers need the ability and wisdom to coordinate and resolve these, maintaining a good environment 
for the team rather than just passing on pressure.
- Strategy must be clearly communicated top-down to every employee, so everyone can judge whether their actions align 
with strategy.

In practice, we have seen many cases where good strategies are undermined by frontline execution, leading to poor results. 
Some managers, to meet numerical targets, resort to various means, even falsification or window dressing. Such behavior 
not only fails to achieve strategic goals but also wastes significant resources.

## Building Team Culture

Team culture is the cornerstone of long-term, stable development. A healthy culture fosters trust and collaboration, 
reduces internal friction, and enhances efficiency and creativity.

- Team culture should be based on respect and trust, encouraging open communication and building mutual trust.
- Decision-making should combine democracy and centralization: listen to team members’ opinions, but make quick decisions 
when necessary to avoid inefficiency.
- Advocate the principle of “focus on issues, not people,” addressing problems rather than individuals, and avoid personal 
emotions affecting the team atmosphere.
- Use processes and mechanisms to detect errors early, not blame members for making mistakes. Create an environment that 
allows trial and error, stimulating innovation and improvement. Post-mortems should focus on root causes and process gaps, 
not excessive personal accountability. Avoid the negative mindset of “the more you do, the more mistakes you make; do nothing, 
make no mistakes.”
- Collaboration should be the goal across roles, avoiding artificial conflicts of interest and creating a supportive, 
progressive work environment.

Through continuous cultural development, teams can better meet challenges and maintain long-term competitiveness and vitality.
